<p>The chart data came from : <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/data-trend/society-and-demographics/hispanics/"> For 1980-2000, Pew Research Center analysis of U.S. decennial census data. For 2005-2013 American Community Survey (IPUMS)</a>.</p>

<p>The U.S. Hispanic population is becoming a big part of the country’s population growth especially in 2008. Hispanic Population according to the GrowthThe Census Bureau’s annual population estimates their demographics in different categories, including race and ethnicity and age. In fact, the county with the highest Hispanic population by far is Los Angeles County in California followed by Harris County in Texas.

<h2> Party Identification in the U.S</h2>    
<!-- add the div and the code below this comment -->

<div id="secondchart" style="min-width: 200px"; height: 200px"></div>

<p>The chart data came from: <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/data-trend/political-attitudes/party-identification/">Pew Research Center</a>.</p>

<p> When it comes to Party Identification, Democrats have lost ground since 2009 among Hispanic registered voters. Also, this is measured by two measures of support which are based on party affiliation. However, we can see in the graph that democrats still hold an advantage over Republicans. The main point here is that Democratic losses does not mean that there are republican gains when it comes to the hispanic community.

Also, it is clear that Democrats hold advantages in party identification among blacks, Asians, Hispanics, well-educated citizens. On the other side, Republicans have leads among y white men and those with less education.</p>

<p>The relationship here is clear, meaning that with the increase of the Hispanic population in the United States, there has been a decrease in the number of Republican people in the United States. Also, there has been a little decrease in the number of democrats.

The main issue here that we can see a huge increase in the number of independents in the United States. In fact, according to Pew Research Center there is huge amount of hispanics saying that they are starting to see no difference between the two parties and that is why they are leaning more towards the Independent Party which is clearly increasing in this graph. </p>
